    Up to now, Qiskit Nature could only map bosonic operators to qubit operators using
    a linear encoding (see :class:`.BosonicLinearMapper`).

    This release introduces a new mapper for the BosonicOp, the BosonicLogarithmicMapper.
    It is more efficient both in terms of the number of qubits required and the Pauli strings generated.
    as it allows to map the BosonicOp with a binary encoding. This mapper is based
    on `this paper <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06580>`_.
    To use this mapper one can for example:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import BosonicLogarithmicMapper
      mapper = BosonicLogarithmicMapper(max_occupation=2)
      qubit_op = mapper.map(bos_op)
